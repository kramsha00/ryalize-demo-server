## Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:
- **PHP**: Version 8.1 or higher
- **Composer**: Dependency manager for PHP
- **Symfony CLI** (optional but recommended)
- **MySQL** (or the database system specified in `.env`)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local environment:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install PHP Dependencies

Use Composer to install the dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Add the provided .env file to the root directory. 
This file contains configurations for the database and other environment settings. 
Update the database connection details if needed:

```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@127.0.0.1:3306/database_name?serverVersion=8.0"
```

Replace username, password, 127.0.0.1, 3306, and database_name with your local MySQL configurations.

### 4. Database Setup

1. **Create the Database:**

```bash 
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
```

2. **Run Migrations:**

Apply migrations to create tables and the initial schema:

```bash
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

## Project Structure

Below is an overview of key files and directories in the Symfony project.

### Key Directories and Files

```
src/                    
    Controller/         # Controller files handling all http requests and responses
    Entity/             # Entity classes representing database tables.
    Repository/         # Repositories to manage database interactions for entities.
    DataFixtures/       # Fixture files to auto-populate database with dummy data
config/                 # Configuration files for Symfony and bundles used within the project.
migrations/             # Database migration files generated by Doctrine.
tests/                  # Contains test files for unit and functional testing.
```


### Important Files

```
.env: Environment configuration file for setting variables like database credentials.

README.md: Documentation for setting up and understanding the project.
```

## Running the Server

After setting up, start the Symfony server:

```bash
symfony serve
```

The app should now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.


## Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Errors:** Ensure that database credentials in .env are correct and that your database server is running.
2. **Permission Issues:** Make sure PHP and the web server have the necessary permissions for project files.
3. **Cache Issues:** If you encounter unexpected behavior, clear the cache:

```bash
php bin/console cache:clear
```
